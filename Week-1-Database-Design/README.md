# Week 1 – Fraud Detection Design (Member 3)

## Role
Machine Learning & Fraud Logic Engineer

## Objective
Design the fraud detection intelligence layer for SentinelStream,
including fraud rules, ML approach, and risk scoring logic.

## Work Completed
- Identified common fraud scenarios in digital payments
- Designed rule-based fraud detection logic
- Planned ML features for anomaly detection
- Selected ML approach (Isolation Forest)
- Defined data flow with backend and frontend
- Designed fraud risk scoring and decision logic

## Key Decisions
1. Layered fraud detection (Rules + ML).
2. Unsupervised learning used due to lack of labeled fraud data.
3. Final decision based on combined rule score and ML score.

## Integration Notes
- Fraud logic aligns with backend API payloads.
- ML inference designed for low-latency execution.
- All fraud decisions are explainable.

## Status
Week 1 completed by Member 3.
